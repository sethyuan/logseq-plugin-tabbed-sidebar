## Feature Highlights

- Manage the blocks/pages opened in the right sidebar as tabs to improve UX when there are multiple items.
- Double clicking or shift + clicking a tab will jump to the corresponding block/page in the main page area.
- The tab bar supports the display of the page icon property.
- Batch closing tabs is possible through the context menu.
- Drag to reorder the tabs.
- Tabs can be pinned. A pinned tab is placed on the leftmost part, it is always opened and occupies just the size of an icon.
- Tabs can be moved up and down so you can browse multiples tabs at the same time.
